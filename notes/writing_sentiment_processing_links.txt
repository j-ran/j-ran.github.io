(1)
A library for sentiment analysis in Python.
It is built for researchers, and so while it is very well put together, it is not so straightforward to use.
“spaCy”
Try some code: https://spacy.io/usage/models
Some of spaCy’s features here: https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#features
Uses Penn-Treebank annotation method. That is a research method. See:
https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/publications.shtml

(2)
API that parses phrases
Would probably need Markov chains to get a score
“SenticNet"

(3)
API that parses phrases (also, like the above)
Didn’t look too much …
“MeaningCloud”

This is a collection of tools.
It’s a mix of tactics, and it still needs to be looked at.

(5)
This is a lexicon-based (i.e., word-by-word) scoring system. 
Interesting, but uses “domain-specific” lexicons such as ‘sports’ and ‘female,’ making me feel the thinking in this work is old-fashioned.
“SocialSent”

(6)
Spelling-based library
To help figure out if a word is a word, there is a library.
“PyEnchant”
https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/

(7)
Simple text-to-emotion python file
Probably TOO simple / simplistic to be meaningful
""text2emotion"
