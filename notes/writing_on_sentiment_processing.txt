This project is about COLLECTIVE EMOTION IN COVID TIME. It is an experiment in trauma-amelioration. The project supposes, at its most basic level, that if a person feels a part of something outside of themselves, it gives them resilience. It seeks to achieve that feeling by offering a way to make your words appear as part of a collective of many people's words. 

All this is based in emotional impact.

By Words-in-Common	  By Emotion

Dr. Paul Ekman        Dr. Robert Plutchik 
(1990s)				  (1950s)

1				      1

2				      2

3				      3

4				      4

5				      5

And, in fact, spaCy.io, a great library for the sophisticated linguistic analysis techniques employed in Natural Language Processing (which help program AIs such as Siri and Alexa) has extensive treatment of syntax.

So, how to group these phrases –


– in a way that EMPHASIZES THE EMOTIONAL RECOGNITION you feel when you encounter them?
